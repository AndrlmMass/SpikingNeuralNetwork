This project aims to develop AGI-inspired SNN models that can perform online learning without labelling of data. It is based on a predictive coding inspired framework of the mind, and is the flagship project of the BONXAI group at NMBU.

Currently, the study is in its initial phase, developing a basic SNN model which will serve as the foundation of the model. 

Disclaimer: The project will be posted for the public later, still to be decided. Stay tuned!
